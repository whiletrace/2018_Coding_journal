# 2018_Coding_Journal
A repository coding journal to keep track of my coding, learning, and progress throughout the year of 2018 and beyond.

<strong>01/08/2018 ES2015 review </strong> </br>
starting the year with some treehouse review of ES2015 review I have been using ES2015 in my code for sometime however feel its important to start the year somewhere, also its a module I have to finish in the Fullstack Javascript track so I started with let and const. I'll finish the module and post some musings into a repository in the morning.
